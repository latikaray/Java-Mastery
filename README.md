# ðŸš€ Java Mastery Through Challenges â€“ KG Coding Course

Welcome to my Java playground! ðŸŽ¯  
This repository is a journey through **every core concept in Java**, tackled through hands-on **challenges, exercises, and real practice problems**â€”all inspired by the **Java Certification Course by KG Coding**.

## ðŸ“š What This Is

This isn't just a bunch of Java filesâ€”it's my personal revision vault built from the ground up by solving coding problems that reflect real understanding.  
Whether you're learning Java or revisiting the foundations, this repo walks through **everything from basic syntax to multithreading and functional programming**â€”challenge by challenge.
